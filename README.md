## Getting started

### Installation

`flog` is currently a _work-in-progress_, however a fully functional _pre-release_ of version `1.0.0` is available for [download](https://github.com/marcransome/flog/releases/tag/1.0.0-pre-release) as a universal macOS binary with support for both Intel `x86_64` and Apple `arm64e` architectures.

> **Note**:
> Pre-release builds are not code signed, or notarized, and will require the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute to be removed using the `xattr` command before they can be run.

To extract and run the pre-release version:

```bash
tar -xvzf flog-1.0.0-pre-release.tar.gz
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine flog
./flog
...
```

### Logging messages

To log a message using `default` log level:

```bash
flog '<message>'
```

Optionally specify a _subsystem_ and/or _category_ using the `-s|--subsystem` and `-c|--category` options:

```bash
flog -s uk.co.fidgetbox -c general 'informational message'
```

Override the default log level using the `-l|--level` option and one of the values `info`, `debug`, `error` or `fault`:

```bash
flog -l fault -s uk.co.fidgetbox -c general 'unrecoverable failure'
```

> **Warning**:
> Log message strings are _public_ by default and can be read using the `log(1)` command or [Console](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/console/welcome/mac) app. To mark a message as private add the `-p|--private` option to the command. Doing so will redact the message string, which will be shown as `'<private>'` when accessed using the methods previously mentioned. [Device Management Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement) can be used to grant access to private log messages.

### Reading log messages

Refer to the `log(1)` man page provided on macOS-based systems for extensive documentation on how to access system wide log messages, or alternatively use the [Console](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/console/welcome/mac) app.

Here's an example log stream, filtered by subsystem name, showing messages generated by `flog`:
