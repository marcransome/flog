`flog` is a command-line tool for sending log messages to Apple's unified logging system and is primarily intended for use in scripts.

<hr>

## Rationale

> _Why not use `logger(1)`?_

`logger` doesn't support the full set of log levels offered by Apple's unified logging system, and it lacks support for _subsystem_ and _category_ strings. `flog` uses the C language APIs for the unified logging system and supports both.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
brew install marcransome/tap/flog
```

### Logging messages

To log a message using the `default` log level:

```shell
flog '<message>'
```

Optionally specify a _subsystem_ and _category_ using the `-s, --subsystem` and `-c, --category` options:

```shell
flog -s uk.co.fidgetbox -c general 'informational message'
```

Override the default log level using the `-l, --level` option and one of the values `info`, `debug`, `error` or `fault`:

```shell
flog -l fault -s uk.co.fidgetbox -c general 'unrecoverable failure'
```

`flog` can also read the log message from the standard input stream using a pipe:

```shell
./some-script | flog -l info
```

Or the log message can be read from a file using shell redirection:

```shell
flog < /var/log/some-script.log
```

Use the `-a, --append` option to also append the log message to a file (creating the file if necessary):

```shell
flog -a /var/log/some-script.log -l fault -s uk.co.fidgetbox -c general 'unrecoverable failure'
```

> [!WARNING]
> Log message strings are _public_ by default and can be read using the `log(1)` command or [Console](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/console/welcome/mac) app. To mark a message as private add the `-p|--private` option to the command. Doing so will redact the message string, which will be shown as `'<private>'` when accessed using the methods previously mentioned. [Device Management Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement) can be used to grant access to private log messages.

### Reading log messages

Refer to the `log(1)` man page provided on macOS-based systems for extensive documentation on how to access system wide log messages, or alternatively use the [Console](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/console/welcome/mac) app.

Here's an example log stream in Console, filtered by subsystem name, showing messages generated by `flog`:

And here's a similar log stream viewed with Apple's `log(1)` command:

## Development

`flog` is written in C and requires a suitable compiler and additional tools to build from source. The [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner is used to manage the development and release process, which functions in a similar manner to `make`. For an overview of the available recipes and their usage run `just --list`.

### Requirements

* macOS `11.x` (Big Sur) or later
* A C17 compiler
* CMake version `>=3.22`
* The [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
* `pkg-config` version `>=0.29.2`
* `libpopt` version `>=1.19`
* `libcmocka` version `>=1.1.7`
* [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) (if building the `man` page)

### Building from source

To perform a development build from the project directory:

```shell
just build
```

The resulting `flog` binary will be output to a `build/debug/bin` directory and test targets to `build/debug/test`.

### Running unit tests

To build and execute all test targets:

```shell
just test
```

Alternatively, invoke individual test targets directly from the `build/debug/test` directory. All test target files begin with the prefix `test_` followed by the name of the source file under test.

## Building the man page

To build the man page:

```shell
just man
```

The `flog.1` man page is output to the `man` directory, and is converted from the source file `man/flog.1.md` using [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).
